# PranavGupta_langgraph_MAT496

## Setup
- Setting up vs code for the langgraph project.
- Pasting commands from the given readme file in the github to download the neccesary libraries.

# Module 0
- It explains the basic setup required for the langgraph further
- It has the information regarding the different fields of chat models such as their temperature(Randomness), stream(stream chunks of response), invoke.

# Module 1
## Lesson 1: Motivation
- LLM uses control flow. (very reliable as same path taken every time)
- ⁠Agent is a control flow determined by an LLM.
⁠- When we go from a simple agent (router) to complex (autonomous) the application reliability decreases and the level of control increases. (as the randomness for the autonomous is much more than simple agent)

- ⁠We can balance reliability with langgraph according to our need.
- Langgraph comes with an IDE which helps you visulaise and debug the agents that you build.
